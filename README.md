## Final_Project
### Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Sentiment Analysis of Disneyland Visitor Reviews
- Analyzed 42,000+ Disneyland reviews using NLP techniques (text cleaning, tokenization) and sentiment analysis with the Bing lexicon, visualizing key terms with word clouds.
- Created network plots for bigrams to show relationships between frequently co-occurring words.
- Developed predictive models (SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression) to classify sentiments and predict ratings.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Spotify Reviews
- Analyzed 51,473 Spotify user reviews using NLP techniques such as tokenizing reviews, removing stop words, cleaning text, creating word frequency plots, and sentiment analysis using techniques like tf-idf and sentiment lexicons.
- Examined common words in positive and negative reviews, and visualize results through bar charts and word clouds.

### Python-Based Recommender Systems & Image Classification
- Developed a content-based movie recommender system using TF-IDF and sigmoid kernel, providing personalized movie recommendations based on similarity scores.
- Trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification on a dataset of animal images (cats, dogs, snakes), achieving high accuracy through iterative training and evaluation.
